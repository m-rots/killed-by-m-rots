# Killed by m-rots

I have built quite a few projects so far. And while many are still alive, a lot of them have been buried in my GitHub Graveyard.

Killed by m-rots is a website containing all of these killed projects, inspired by [Killed by Google](https://killedbygoogle.com).

## Building the website

Make sure you have installed [Zola](https://www.getzola.org).

### Running the development server

```bash
zola serve
```

### Building the production website

```bash
zola build
```
